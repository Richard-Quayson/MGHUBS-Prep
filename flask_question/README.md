# MyDevConnect
## Backend assignment

### Instructions
Develop a RESTful API using Flask and sqlite3. Users should be able to perform a POST request to create a new user, and the data should be persisted in a sqlite3 database.

We have already created a sqlite3 database file called users.db
In it we have created a basic users table by running the command:
CREATE TABLE users (id integer primary key autoincrement, first_name, last_name, email)

### Resources

### What to do on completion?
Compress your code into a zip file and send it to support@mydevconnect.com
